- ####How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I spent about six hours on the test. 
I'd add pagination on the frontend and I'd add checks that HTML is safe before displaying it on the frontend.
I'd also cancel previous filtration requests if they are still processing and a new one has already been sent.

- ####How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
I'd check that the server hardware is powerful enough.<br> 
If the performance problems are related to long processing database queries then I'd dump the database and drill down locally into how I can improve performance.<br>
If a problem with a frontend, for example a page freezes, then it is quite possible that the problem is in an infinite loop.<br>
For backend, I use xdebuger to understand the problem faster and more accurately.

I had experience in debugging and optimizing performance problems with frontend(JS), backend(php) and database(mysql).
